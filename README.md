# SolarWindsPython
An attempt at my Solar Winds concept in Python

The long term goal is a game where you control one or more automated drones. It starts on a planet, where you mine for the resources you need to take to space. Once in space you can continue to mine, no longer limited to a single planet (or even to planets) while building up your automaton empire. OSLT. The original plan was to make a MUD using the TinyMARE engine, but there were too many limitations to make the universe as large as I wanted it to be.

# Requirements
The following Python libraries are required:

  * **curses**			included with python (on Linux, sorry Windows users!)
  * **pickle**      included with python
  * **random**			included with python
  * **sqlite3**			included with python 2.5+
  * **OpenSimplex** 	available via pip as `opensimplex`

  TL;DR: **Python 2.5+**, `pip install opensimplex`
